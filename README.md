Originally for PyBanks I wanted to sort the information into dict. However I couldn't get it to work after 2 hours so I resorted to using a more basic way to get the results I needed for the assignment.
If I were to redo the assignment I would look into how I originallly wanted to do it but because of time restraints I went with what I knew how to do rather than spend an unknown amount of time on doing it with another method.
For PyPoll I took similar steps with how I did PyBank without a lot of change
The biggest issue I had with the module was figuring out how to export. Looking back at the activities I managed to find something that would work but it felt like I wasn't using it properly
Overall I felt like my code wasn't efficent but at the end of the day it works however I know I can do better.
Maybe in a few weeks when I feel more comfortable with everything after rewatching the lectures I will reattempt the assignment with a better plan.
